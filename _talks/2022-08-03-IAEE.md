We introduce a new approach to optimize energy system models coupled with numerical
hydrothermal groundwater simulations. Such coupling schemes are required to analyze future energy systems with a
high penetration of groundwater heat pumps, since their efficiency and installation approvals depend significantly on groundwater
temperatures. The proposed optimization approach combines different strategies to solve the underlying black-box
optimization problem.
