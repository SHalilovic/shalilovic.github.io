Groundwater heat pump systems are one of the key technologies for the energy transition of heating and cooling sectors. These systems alternate groundwater temperature and cause thermal plumes, which propagate in the aquifer. The plumes can reach neighboring systems and deteriorate their operation or cause regulatory issues. Hence, it is important to optimally position these systems to avoid negative interactions and maximize the spatial potential of thermal groundwater use. Processes that take place in groundwater, i.e. flow and heat transport, are described with a system of nonlinear coupled PDEs. Therefore, the underlying problem is a PDE-constrained optimization problem, which includes control (spatial coordinates of wells) and state (groundwater temperature) constraints. The decision as to whether or not a particular groundwater heat pump is installed can be modeled with binary variables. In this talk, we will introduce an adjoint-based approach to solve this mixed-integer PDE-constrained optimization problem. The approach is tested with various numbers of heat pumps and applied to real case scenarios, where the geothermal potential within a city district is maximized.
