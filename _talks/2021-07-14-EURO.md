Groundwater heat pump systems alternate groundwater temperature and cause thermal plumes, which can reach neighboring systems and deteriorate their operation or cause regulatory issues. 
Hence, it is important to optimally position these systems to maximize the spatial potential of thermal groundwater use. 
The decision as to whether or not a particular groundwater heat pump is installed can be modeled with binary variables. 
In this talk, we introduce an adjoint-based approach to solve the resulting mixed-integer PDE-constrained optimization problem.
