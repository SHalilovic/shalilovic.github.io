In this talk, we compare two different optimization approaches for the placement of groundwater heat pump wells. 
The first approach is based on the linear advective heat transport model (LAHM), which is an analytical model, and integer linear programming. 
The second approach is based on numerical simulation of groundwater flow and heat transport and adjoint method for the optimization.
