Optimization of shallow geothermal systems (SGS) falls into the area of PDE-constrained optimization since the underlying physical phenomena, i.e. groundwater flow and subsurface heat transport, are described by PDEs. 
In this talk, we focus on two specific cases of such problems: design optimization of open-loop SGS, which involves optimal well placement, and optimal control of a closed-loop SGS. 
To address these optimization problems, we propose adjoint-based optimization approaches that use the Firedrake framework for the forward simulation model and the Dolfin adjoint tool for automatically generating discrete adjoint PDEs.
