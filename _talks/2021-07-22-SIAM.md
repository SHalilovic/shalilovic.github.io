It is important to optimally position groundwater heat pumps systems to avoid their negative thermal interactions and maximize overall profitability.
The underlying problem is a PDE-constrained optimization problem including control (spatial coordinates) and state (groundwater temperature) constraints.
In this talk, we introduce an adjoint-based approach to solve this non-smooth PDE-constrained optimization problem.
